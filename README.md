# RayCastingDemo

In this demo, the mouse pointer acts as the light source and emmits rays that terminate in either the randomly generated walls or into the border of the windows.
Each ray is a straight line that checks for intersection with any of the mentioned 2-D lines and finalizes the neaest point of inersection as the end point for the ray.
The process runs again for each ray every frame, giving the illusion of luminance.
